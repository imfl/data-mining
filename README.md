Matrix Profile (MP) has emerged as a new concept in the data mining community since 2016. It is a framework to extract information from time series, which can be later applied in similarity research. Two steps are involved:

1. construct a matrix profile
2. use the matrix profile

In Step 1, the current setting uses the traditional Euclidean distance to measure how similar two subsequences are. However, a better approach would be using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. See the graph below for intuition.

As an initial attempt in the academic community, I introduced DTW into MP.

The main challenge is -- the time complexity for computing DTW is sizeable even for a single pair of points. It is infeasible to compute it for all the entries in a matrix.

My originalities are

1. computing lower bounds to skip many unnecessary computations
2. using randomized local search within each column of the matrix

### Instructions

The instructions on how to compile and use my code, and a full description of every source file and the dataset are [here](README.pdf) (PDF).

### Summary

An abstract of this project is [here](summary/abstract.pdf) (PDF).

The empirical results are [here](summary/results.pdf) (PDF).

### More Information

This project is an academic project that I did together with Lee Yik-Yeung, for *COMP5331: Knowledge Discovery in Databases*, a PhD-level course that I took at the CS department at HKUST in Fall 2017.

This project was supervised by [Prof. Raymond Wong](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/), one of the best teachers that I has ever met in my life. I would like to take this chance to again express my gratitude.

I am responsible for any errors and shortcomings in the algorithms and the code.
